/*!
 * Simple guard object for calling a function when the guard is destroyed.
 *
 * The wrapped function is guaranteed to be called when the guard object is
 * destroyed. This is useful for cleanups or similar actions that must be
 * executed after certain other actions have been executed. This may sound much
 * like a custom deleter, but a #Guard is neither tied to \c unique_ptr nor to
 * the life time of objects.
 *
 * Of course, the situations pictured above could always be implemented by
 * calls of explicit callback functions. It is, however, easily possible to
 * forget to add the corresponding calls to the code, especially if the code is
 * convoluted or throws exceptions. Moving a #Guard object to the code in
 * question is much safer because the wrapped function is going to be called
 * for sure as soon as the object is destroyed when it goes out of scope.
 *
 * \note
 *     The wrapped function should not throw exceptions. If it does, then the
 *     exception will be caught and silently thrown away.
